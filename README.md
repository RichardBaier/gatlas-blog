# Gatlas Blog

## Summary 
I decided to push myself to be a better coder in the hopes of landing my first job. I decided to start a weekly project, where I build a new project every week.  I am hoping to expand my skill set and impress potential employers.  

The Week 1 Project is a personal blog where I intend to update viewers on my coding journey.
